## Requirements:

A virtual environment with:
* Python 3.5+
* OpenLock and all of its dependencies

## Steps to produce documentation

1. Create the RST output from the dogstring-ed .py files with:

```
sphinx-apidoc -o source/ ../
```
from inside the docs directory. RST files are written to `docs/source/`

2. (Optional) If rebuilding the RST output, first `rm source/*`.

3. Create HTML files with `make html` (from inside the docs directory).

Index of the HTML output is located at docs/_build/html/index.html
