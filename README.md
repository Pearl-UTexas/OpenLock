# OpenLock

OpenLock is an OpenAI Gym environment, designed for transfer learning. The environment is governed by compositional structure that requires reasoning about an abstract latent state. OpenLock is a virtual "escape room" where agents are required to interact with levers in order to open the door. Agents are required to find _all_ solutions within a room. After completing a single room, agents are moved to a new room with the same underlying abstract structure, but the positions of each lever has been changed. 

This experimental setup is designed to test whether or not agents are capable of forming an abstract representation of the task.

The gif below summarizes the environment's execution and how lever positions change between rooms:

The environment supports a number of scenarios, each of which encode a specific locking mechanism that governs the environment:

## Installation
To install:

1. Use Python 3.5+

2. Install the following system-level packages:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk graphviz graphviz-dev
```

2. Create a virtual envrionment for OpenLock. Then run:
```
python setup.py install
```

3. Finally, install pybox2d 2.3.2 from source (https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
